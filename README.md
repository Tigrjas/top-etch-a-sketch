# Etch-a-Sketch

A browser-based sketchpad project inspired by the classic Etch-A-Sketch toy â€” built to flex your **DOM manipulation** and **Flexbox** layout skills using **JavaScript**, **HTML**, and **CSS**.

## Features

- A **16x16 grid** of squares generated dynamically with JavaScript.
- Hovering over squares creates a pixelated drawing effect.
- A **"New Grid"** button lets users enter a new grid size (up to 100x100).
- Responsive grid layout built entirely with **Flexbox**.
